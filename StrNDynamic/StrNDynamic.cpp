/*
1) Implement a string matching function using Finite Automata. 
The challenge here is in the choice of "compute-transition" function.
The function should be able to search for any substring within 
any other longer string and return the index corresponding with 
the first matching position.

2) We discussed the knapsack problem as an example of Dynamic Programming. 
Another famous problem is that of the Traveling Salesman. In your own words, 
describe the traveling salesman problem as well as why this is so hard to solve. 
Are there any known solutions? Describe how you might go about solving 
this problem using Dynamic Programming - cite any algorithms or sources 
that you find in formulating your response.
